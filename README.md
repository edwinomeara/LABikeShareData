# LABikeShareData

Capital One Summit project using a large CSV file to create a web app with visual graphs. Had to develop a web app using a CSV file with over 130,000 entries that analyzes and visualizes bike share data from the city of Los Angeles. 

## Requirements:
1. Data Visuals: Display or graph 3 metrics or trends from the data set that are interesting to you.
2. Which start/stop stations are most popular?
3. What is the average distance traveled?
4. How many riders include bike sharing as a regular part of their commute?

## Tools and APIs used:
* [Papa Parse](https://www.papaparse.com/)
* [C3.js](https://c3js.org/)
* [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
