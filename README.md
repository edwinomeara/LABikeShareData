# LABikeShareData

Capital One Summit project using a large CSV file to create a web app with visual graphs. Had to develop a web app using a CSV file with over 130,000 entries that analyzes and visualizes bike share data from the city of Los Angeles. 

 Here's a link to the project: [LABikeShareData](https://edwinomeara.github.io/LABikeShareData/)
 
 Here's the CSV file used (Warning pretty big file): [LABikeShareData CSV](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/edwinomeara/LABikeShareData/master/dataAndImages/metrobikesharetripdata.csv)
